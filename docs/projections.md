# Projections and Rebuilds

Projection rows are deterministic read models derived from immutable events.

Use `evt.RebuildProjections` when:

- a projector bug wrote incorrect view rows
- a new view is added for existing aggregate streams
- a view payload schema changes
- an operator wants to validate projection health against the event log

During a rebuild, the repository streams entities, the caller-supplied replay
function reconstitutes aggregate state, and projectors produce transaction
groups. In dry-run mode, `evt` reports the work without writing rows.

The rebuild contract deliberately makes writes explicit through `CommitGroup` so
adopters can choose the safest commit strategy for their storage backend.
