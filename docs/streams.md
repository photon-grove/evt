# Streams, Projectors, and Publishers

Once events land in the [DynamoDB event log](dynamodb.md), they fan out to
asynchronous consumers — read-model projectors, change-detection
[heads](projections.md), search indexers, feeds, webhooks — through a single hop:

```text
event log ──DynamoDB Stream──▶ publisher ──▶ SNS topic ──┬──▶ SNS→SQS ──▶ projector
              (NEW_IMAGE)      (one reader)               ├──▶ SNS→SQS ──▶ heads / search / …
                                                          └──▶ SNS→Lambda ──▶ feeds / webhooks
```

The **blessed path is this SNS fan-out.** Exactly one consumer reads the DynamoDB
Stream — the **publisher** — and republishes each event to an SNS topic. Every
other consumer subscribes to that topic (usually over SNS→SQS with raw message
delivery) and runs independently, so the stream keeps a single cheap reader and
consumers scale and fail in isolation. The `publishers` and `projectors` packages
are the Lambda runtimes for the two ends of that path; both process **only
`INSERT` records** — the append of a new event — skipping `MODIFY`/`REMOVE`.

Every consumer follows the same reliability contract: process records
independently, return **partial-batch failures** so only affected records retry,
and stay **idempotent** because the same event can be delivered more than once.

> A projector can also read the DynamoDB Stream **directly** via
> `projectors.NewLambdaHandler`, skipping the topic. That's a supported
> alternative for the occasional consumer that warrants it — but prefer the
> SNS/SQS handlers below unless you have a specific reason.

## Projectors

A projector consumes events from the SNS fan-out and maintains a read model. You
implement the `Projector` interface, wrap it in a runtime, and serve it with the
SQS handler — the topic delivered over SNS→SQS with raw message delivery:

```go
type Projector interface {
    Process(ctx context.Context, records []projectors.StreamRecord) ([]projectors.BatchItemFailure, error)
    Name() string // stable identity for idempotency keys and telemetry
}

func main() {
    runtime := projectors.NewRuntime(
        myProjector,
        idempotencyGuard,   // projectors.IdempotencyGuard
        slog.Default(),
    )
    lambda.Start(projectors.NewSQSHandler(runtime))
}
```

`NewSQSHandler` decodes each SQS message — the CloudWatchEvent envelope the
publisher emitted — into a `StreamRecord` with `StreamRecordFromEnvelope`, runs
the batch through the runtime, and returns an `events.SQSEventResponse` so Lambda
redelivers only the failed messages. For a latency-sensitive consumer wired as a
**direct** SNS→Lambda subscription, use `NewSNSHandler` instead; SNS has no
partial-batch protocol, so a failure retries the whole invocation — give that
subscription a redrive policy. (`NewLambdaHandler` is the direct-from-stream
variant noted above.)

The runtime adds:

- **idempotency** keyed by `(projector name, event ID)` — provide a durable
  `IdempotencyGuard` in production (a DynamoDB-backed one);
  `projectors.NewInMemoryIdempotencyGuard()` is fine for tests and single-process
  runs. The projector **name must be stable**: renaming it resets dedup history.
- **retry classification** — wrap unrecoverable errors with
  `projectors.NewPermanentError(err)` to route them to partial-batch failures
  (and ultimately a DLQ); transient errors (timeouts, context deadlines) retry the
  whole invocation.
- **partial-batch failure responses** — `NewSQSHandler` returns an
  `events.SQSEventResponse{BatchItemFailures: […]}` (and `NewLambdaHandler` a
  `DynamoDBStreamResponse{…}`) so Lambda re-delivers only the failed records.
- **structured logging** through the `*slog.Logger` you pass in (falling back to
  `slog.Default()` when nil).

## Publishers

`evt/publishers` is the single DynamoDB-Stream consumer: it reads committed
events and republishes them to the SNS topic the consumers above subscribe to.
The handler takes a `StreamPublisher` and a `BudgetController`:

```go
func HandleDynamoDBEvent(
    ctx context.Context,
    event events.DynamoDBEvent,
    publisher StreamPublisher,
    budget BudgetController,
    loggers ...*slog.Logger,
) (events.DynamoDBEventResponse, error)
```

The included **SNS publisher** (from the `stream` package) wraps each event in a
CloudWatchEvent-shaped envelope — `{ID, Source, DetailType, Detail}`, with the full
serialized event in `Detail` — and adds SNS message attributes (`entityType`,
`eventType`, `commandId`, `correlationId`) so subscribers can filter without
parsing the body:

```go
publisher, err := stream.NewSNSPublisher(snsClient, topicARN, "account-service",
    // Optional: also publish to a FIFO companion topic for ordered consumers,
    // deduplicated by event ID, grouped by whatever key you extract.
    stream.WithFIFOTarget(fifoTopicARN, groupIDForEvent),
)
```

A `BudgetController` (`publishers.NewBudgetController(eventsPerMinute,
retriesPerMinute, now)`) is a soft per-minute rate limit on ingress and retries,
so a flood of events can't overrun downstream topics. `publishers.LoadConfigFromEnv`
reads the topic ARNs and budgets from the environment for a typical Lambda
deployment.

## Reliability checklist

- **Drop malformed rows deliberately and measure them.** A record that can't be
  decoded should be counted and skipped, not retried forever — the publisher
  reports `DroppedMalformedCount` for this.
- **Return batch item failures, not whole-batch errors,** for retryable problems,
  so successful records in the same batch aren't reprocessed.
- **Keep handlers idempotent.** At-least-once delivery means every projector and
  subscriber must tolerate seeing an event twice.

For rebuilding read models offline (after a projector bug, a schema change, or a
[compaction](dynamodb.md#compaction)), use the synchronous rebuild path instead of
the stream — see [Projections and rebuilds](projections.md).
